# Hi, I’m Munsif 👋

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys building things that actually work in the real world.  
I started with curiosity, broke a lot of things, fixed them, and slowly fell in love with development — especially backend and system logic.

I’m a Full Stack Developer with a strong interest in backend engineering. I like understanding *how things work behind the scenes* — APIs, databases, performance, and clean system design. I also care about the frontend, because good logic deserves a good user experience.

I’m still early in my professional journey, but I’ve spent real time building projects, learning from mistakes, and improving step by step. What I look for now is a professional environment where I can grow, learn from experienced people, and contribute honestly.

I like clean code, simple solutions, and learning by doing.
