# Hi, I’m Munsif 👋

I’m a Full Stack Developer who enjoys building things that actually work in the real world.

I come from a backend-heavy background and like working on APIs, databases, and system logic, but I’m also comfortable building clean, simple user interfaces. I’ve spent most of my time learning by building projects, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding how products work end to end.

Right now, I work mainly with Python (FastAPI), Node.js, Express, React, and SQL/NoSQL databases. I’ve also explored AI-powered features using tools like Groq API and LangGraph, especially for automation and data processing.

I’m still early in my career, but I’m serious about growing as a developer. I learn fast, take responsibility for my work, and enjoy improving code step by step. I’m especially interested in real-world problems, backend systems, and products that scale.

### Tech I work with
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, Express  
- **Frontend:** React, jQuery, Jinja2, Tailwind CSS  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, Linux, REST APIs  

I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and taking on meaningful work.  
If you’re building something interesting, feel free to reach out.
